# SAFE Labs Python Developer Challenge

## Presentation

Hello there SAFE Labs Candidates!

To better assess a candidates development skills, we would like to provide the following challenge. This is intendend to be developed in a pair programming session within an hour of time.

Project description
-------------------

We want to develop a small web app that allows users to order pizza.

First of all we'll display the list of pizzas with ingredients and prices. Data will be loaded from `server/pizzas.json`.

When the user chooses something from the list the order summary will update dynamically.

There will be a button to confirm the order. An ajax call will be performed to `server/order.json` and the result will be displayed as a message like this: "Your order will be delivered in x minutes".

You can use any library/framework/plugin you want.

Please use some template library (http://handlebarsjs.com/, http://mustache.github.io/, ...) or a template engine from the framework.

The application must be single page and JS-based using Angular (1.x is fine if not familiar with >= 2.x) or ReactJS. That means that I load just one html file, if you want to add some navigation you have to implement it via JS.

If you can display discounts for pizzas it's a plus.

Evaluation
----------

Our goal is to find answers to those questions:

* Do you understand the JavaScript language and more in general web technologies?
* Can you judge which library/framework is the best fit for a job and use it correctly?
* Can you design interfaces that are clear and easy to use?
* Do you master your working environment?

Due to the limited time consider the followings:

* It is NOT important to have a fully functional application at the end
* We'll develop just for the latest version of Google Chrome

## Deliverables

The deliverable for this challenge is the code, inside a public GitHub repository of yours. You should provide us the URL for it.

We should be able to run your application on our computers, and your README should have all the information necessary for it. 

Send us a report telling how was your experience with this challenge. Even if you can't finish, send the report because for us is more important to know your dedication on a project, thinking, and analytical skills, than looking only at your technical skills.

We will evaluate you based on how well the system is architected, your code and tooling practices, your instructions and documentation on the README.MD and how well you defend your idea and decisions when presenting it to us.

## Questions?

If you have any questions, please send an email to your contact at SAFE Labs that we will reply as fast as we can :)
